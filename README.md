# Pareto-Dominace

*An objective vector $u = (u_1,…,u_m)$ is said to dominate $v = (v_1,…,v_n)$(denoted by $u\prec v$) if and only if no component of $v$ is smaller than the corresponding component of $u$ and at least one component of $u$ is strictly smaller, that is,*

$\forall i \epsilon \{ 1,…,n\} : u_i \leq v_i \wedge \exists i \epsilon \{ 1,…,n \} : u_i < v_i$
